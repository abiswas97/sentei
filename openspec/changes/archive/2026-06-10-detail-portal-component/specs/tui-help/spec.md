## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Global help overlay via F1
The system SHALL display a help overlay when the user presses `F1` from any view, showing key bindings and descriptions contextual to the active view.

#### Scenario: Help from list view
- **WHEN** the user presses `F1` while on the worktree list view
- **THEN** the portal SHALL open with a title "Help — Worktree List" and content listing all available keys for that view (j/k navigate, space select, enter confirm, / filter, etc.)

#### Scenario: Help from progress view
- **WHEN** the user presses `F1` while on any progress view
- **THEN** the portal SHALL open with a title "Help — <Operation>" and content listing available keys (ctrl+c quit)

#### Scenario: Help from summary view
- **WHEN** the user presses `F1` while on any summary view
- **THEN** the portal SHALL open with a title "Help — <Summary Type>" and content listing available keys

#### Scenario: F1 closes help if already open
- **WHEN** the user presses `F1` while the help overlay is already visible
- **THEN** the help overlay SHALL close (toggle behavior)

### Requirement: Help content is contextual per view
Each view SHALL provide its own help content, so the help overlay shows relevant information for the active view rather than a generic help screen.

#### Scenario: Different views show different help
- **WHEN** the user opens help from the list view and then from the menu view
- **THEN** each SHALL display different key bindings and descriptions relevant to that specific view

#### Scenario: Help content format
- **WHEN** help content is rendered for any view
- **THEN** it SHALL display key bindings in a formatted table: key on the left, description on the right, grouped by category (navigation, actions, etc.)

### Requirement: Contextual details via ?
Views that support contextual details SHALL open the portal with view-specific detail content when the user presses `?`.

#### Scenario: ? on a view with details available
- **WHEN** the user presses `?` on a view that has detail content (e.g., cleanup preview with aggressive details)
- **THEN** the portal SHALL open with the detail content

#### Scenario: ? on a view with no details
- **WHEN** the user presses `?` on a view that has no contextual detail content
- **THEN** nothing SHALL happen (key is ignored, no empty portal)

#### Scenario: ? toggles portal closed
- **WHEN** the user presses `?` while the detail portal is already open (opened via `?`)
- **THEN** the portal SHALL close
