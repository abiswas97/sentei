## Purpose
Covers the --stale, --merged, and --all filter flags for the remove command, including duration parsing, composability, and command scoping.

## Requirements

### Requirement: --stale flag filters worktrees by last commit age
The `remove` command SHALL accept a `--stale <duration>` flag that pre-selects worktrees whose last commit is older than the specified duration.

#### Scenario: Stale filter with TUI
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --stale 30d`
- **THEN** the TUI SHALL display the worktree list with worktrees whose last commit is older than 30 days pre-selected

#### Scenario: Stale filter duration formats
- **WHEN** the user provides `--stale 7d`, `--stale 2w`, or `--stale 3m`
- **THEN** the system SHALL parse the duration as days, weeks, or months respectively

#### Scenario: Invalid stale duration
- **WHEN** the user provides `--stale abc`
- **THEN** the system SHALL print an error: "invalid duration for --stale: expected format like '30d', '2w', or '3m'" and exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Stale filter with --non-interactive
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --stale 30d --force --non-interactive`
- **THEN** the system SHALL delete all worktrees whose last commit is older than 30 days without TUI interaction

### Requirement: --merged flag filters worktrees by merge status
The `remove` command SHALL accept a `--merged` flag that pre-selects worktrees whose branches are fully merged into the default branch.

#### Scenario: Merged filter with TUI
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --merged`
- **THEN** the TUI SHALL display the worktree list with merged-branch worktrees pre-selected

#### Scenario: Merged filter with --non-interactive
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --merged --force --non-interactive`
- **THEN** the system SHALL delete all worktrees with fully merged branches without TUI interaction

#### Scenario: No merged worktrees
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --merged` and no worktrees have merged branches
- **THEN** the TUI SHALL display the list with nothing pre-selected and a message: "No merged worktrees found"

### Requirement: --all flag selects all non-protected worktrees
The `remove` command SHALL accept an `--all` flag that pre-selects all non-protected worktrees.

#### Scenario: All filter with TUI
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --all`
- **THEN** the TUI SHALL display the worktree list with all non-protected worktrees pre-selected

#### Scenario: All filter with --non-interactive requires --force
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --all --non-interactive` without `--force`
- **THEN** the system SHALL print: "destructive operation requires --force with --non-interactive" and exit with code 1

#### Scenario: All filter excludes protected
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --all` and branch "main" is protected
- **THEN** the "main" worktree SHALL NOT be pre-selected

### Requirement: Filter flags are composable
Multiple filter flags on the `remove` command SHALL be combined with OR logic — a worktree is pre-selected if it matches any provided filter.

#### Scenario: Combined stale and merged filters
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --stale 30d --merged`
- **THEN** worktrees that are stale OR merged SHALL be pre-selected

#### Scenario: All overrides other filters
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei remove --all --stale 30d`
- **THEN** all non-protected worktrees SHALL be pre-selected (--all supersedes other filters)

### Requirement: Filter flags only apply to the remove command
Filter flags (`--stale`, `--merged`, `--all`) SHALL only be accepted by the `remove` command. Other commands SHALL reject these flags with an error.

#### Scenario: Filter flag on wrong command
- **WHEN** the user runs `sentei create --stale 30d`
- **THEN** the system SHALL print: "unknown flag: --stale" and exit with code 1
